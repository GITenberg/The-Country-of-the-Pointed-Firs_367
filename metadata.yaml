description: "The Country of the Pointed Firs is an 1896 short story sequence by Sarah\
  \ Orne Jewett which is considered by some literary critics to be her finest work.\
  \ Henry James described it as her \"beautiful little quantum of achievement.\" Ursula\
  \ K. Le Guin praises its \"quietly powerful rhythms.\" Because it is loosely structured,\
  \ many critics view the book not as a novel, but a series of sketches; however,\
  \ its structure is unified through both setting and theme. The novel can be read\
  \ as a study of the effects of isolation and hardship experienced by the inhabitants\
  \ of the decaying fishing villages along the Maine coast.\nSarah Orne Jewett, who\
  \ wrote the book when she was 47, was largely responsible for popularizing the regionalism\
  \ genre with her sketches of the fictional Maine fishing village of Dunnet Landing.\
  \ Like Jewett, the narrator is a woman, a writer, unattached, genteel in demeanor,\
  \ intermittently feisty and zealously protective of her time to write. The narrator\
  \ removes herself from her landlady's company and writes in an empty schoolhouse,\
  \ but she also continues to spend a great deal of time with Mrs. Todd, befriending\
  \ her hostess and her hostess's family and friends.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
